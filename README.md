The code is for the following question:

Qn. -> Assume a kitchen has N chef working. If each Chef can claim at most R ingredients (each ingredient is kept in a jar),
       then find out the total number of ingredients that are present in the kitchen thereby having deadlock free execution of work.
       (Chef can work in any order)
